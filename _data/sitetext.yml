    **Today's educational challenges require a strong technology foundation.**
    <br><br>
    **EdAptiv** combines deep scientific expertise with educational partnerships to design and build tomorrow's technology foundation.
    **EdAptiv** is an alliance of leading researchers in pedagogy-driven AI, adaptive learning algorithms, advanced learning analytics, massive causal evaluation, and formal education theory.
    **EdAptiv** develops cutting-edge educational technology and collaborates on research with both academic and educational partners.
    <br><br>

    **Educational technology must respect individual variability in learning and development.**
    <br><br>
    Children learn and develop in uniquely different ways.
    Different environments and experiences, and their interactions, result in massive developmental variability.
    Cognitive abilities emerge from this complex developmental system.
    Educational technology can and must embrace this variability by optimally supporting children in their individual development.
    **EdAptiv** develops educational technology that respects individual variability *by design*.
    <br><br>

    **Educational AI needs to be informed and driven by pedagogy.**
    <br><br>
    Far too often, educational AI ignores proven pedagogical principles.
    This is a huge missed opportunity and a disdain for the many important findings from substantive educational research.
    Educational AI must not only advance the pedagogical principles that are already effectively used in educational practice, but also enable those principles that are difficult to satisfy under everyday conditions.
    **EdAptiv** develops educational AI that respects pedagogical principles.

        The availability and potential of technology means that digital learning should

        This means connecting every child and young person – some 3.5 billion by

        Agency requires the ability to frame a guiding purpose and identify actions

        Two factors, in particular, help learners enable agency. The first is a personalised
