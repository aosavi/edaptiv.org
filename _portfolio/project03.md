Diagnosing students' cognitive processes, such as multiplication strategies, is a major challenge in adapting education to the individual. Systematic errors hold a key to such latent processes, as these may signal students' misconceptions. We introduced a new method to identify and trace systematic errors. Serving as a recommendation system, this method provides probability estimates for a student's potential misconceptions. The method is derived from the Ising model originating in physics, and exploits a theoretical mapping between latent misconceptions and manifest errors. We evaluated the performance of different model configurations, using single-digit multiplication data from a large-scale adaptive practice system, and key metrics for recommendation systems. The results show that the Systematic Error Tracing (SET) model outranks a majority vote baseline model when two or more recommendations are considered. Also, for some misconceptions it improves the adaptation of recommendations to individual students.
