We constructed a new theory of learning and development in intelligence. We formalized individuals as networks of skills and knowledge that are directly affected by education and accumulate during development. During learning and development, an individual is confronted with new knowledge and skills that are added to the network and that may or may not be acquired. For example, an individual that adopts correct multiplication rules may form connected clusters of acquired skills, whereas an individual that adopts incorrect rules may form unacquired clusters that represent misconceptions. Crucially, wired intelligence theory explains intelligenceâ€™s primary phenomena (e.g., positive manifold) at different stages of development, and allows for unique representations of individuals' cognitive development.
