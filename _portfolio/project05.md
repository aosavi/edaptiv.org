Quitting behavior is a persistent problem in online education, most often studied in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). We work on the prevention of quitting by making formal models of quitting behavior, analyzing data from large-scale online learning systems and by experimenting (A/B testing) on how to adapt the difficulty of questions in learning software. The first take-away: sequential errors must be prevented at all cost.
