Students tend to skip problems that require deliberate effort, and only attempt problems that they can spontaneously answer. To eliminate such effort avoidance, we designed an online field experiment (A/B test), for a large-scale computer adaptive practice system. The intervention delayed the option to skip a problem, thereby promoting effortful practice. The results revealed an increase in the exerted effort, without being at the expense of engagement. In addition to these substantial results, the experiment demonstrated some of the advantages of A/B tests, such as the unique opportunity to apply truly double-blind and randomized controlled field experiments in educational science.
