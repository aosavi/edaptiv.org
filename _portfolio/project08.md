We constructed models to evaluate the level of relational abstraction in items for educational testing. For example, for verbal analogies, this not only helps us determine whether an item is "good" (construct validity), but also whether it taps into relational similarity (e.g., finger : fingernail :: glasses : lens, relation is whole : part) rather than surface level (e.g., lemon : sunflower :: strawberry : poppy, simple relation is same color). The former is something that both young children and AI can have trouble with, whereas the latter is an easy task. We use the obtained insights to evaluate large item sets and determine whether items are fit to include in abstract reasoning games. The AI models can then, in turn, be used to generate valid answer alternatives to the items in these games. Finally, another aspect of this project is developing machine learning models to automatically score open-ended items such as those in creative divergent thinking tasks, which is notoriously subjective and time-consuming.
