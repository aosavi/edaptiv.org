The [ShareStats](https://www.sharestats.nl/) project aims to create and share a large statistics item bank with the professional community of methods and statistics instructors in higher education. By making this item bank freely available under a creative commons license, the items can be used in adaptive applications. All items will be made available as [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) files, and can be compiled to many formats using the [One-for-All Exams Generator](http://www.r-exams.org/intro/oneforall/). Updates will be posted on the ShareStats website.
