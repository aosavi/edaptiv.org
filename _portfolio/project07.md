Online learning environments can both expand and limit teachers' pedagogical tools. In Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs), a popular branch of online learning, teachers could benefit greatly from increased pedagogical flexibility. In this project, we introduced a tool that equips teachers with such flexibility. This tool exploits Qualtrics, popular software for creating and distributing surveys, to extend native MOOC functionality with random assignment, additional educational elements, and options for personalizing educational content. The tool is not only available to MOOC teachers, but can also be easily adapted to any online learning environment that supports the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) protocol. Ultimately, the tool can be used to enable iterative and domain-specific evidence-based improvements to online learning environments.
